# FPGA-driver
this is a c driver for running modern CNNS on FPGA

### Done:
```
1.resnet50,resnet18,SSD,YOLOV3 has been deployed successfully
2.this is a driver and computation actions (such as conv and fc) are defined by RTL 
```

### TO DO:

```
1.auto complier from pytorch/caffe net to fpga_net
2.random pruning makes Load imbalance,RTL code may need to be improved
3.generate net_def automatically
```
